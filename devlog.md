- **Thoughts**:
  - The project requires implementing a B-Tree structure stored in index files, with interactive commands for managing the tree.
  - The file format includes strict specifications for headers, nodes, and byte ordering, which will need to be handled carefully.
  - Plan to use Python for its simplicity in handling file I/O and byte manipulation.

- **Plan**:
  - Design the B-Tree class and the structure for nodes.
  - Implement the `create` method to generate index files with proper headers.
  - Test file creation and ensure it matches the project specifications.

- **Thoughts**:
  - Successfully implemented the `create` command, which initializes an index file with the correct header format.
  - Tested the magic number and header block in the file, and it is correctly stored.
  - Started designing the `BTreeNode` structure to handle keys, values, and children.

- **Plan**:
  - Add the `open` command to verify existing files and load their headers.
  - Implement a basic menu system to handle user interaction.

- **Thoughts**:
  - The `open` command is implemented and checks the magic number for file validity.
  - The menu system is functional and accepts case-insensitive commands.
  - Encountered challenges with managing memory for B-Tree nodes while ensuring only 3 nodes are in memory at a time.

- **Plan**:
  - Begin implementing the `insert` command for adding key-value pairs.
  - Focus on maintaining the B-Tree properties and splitting nodes as necessary.
  - Test the `open` command with various valid and invalid files.

- **Thoughts**:
  - The `insert` method is partially implemented, but node splitting needs debugging to handle cases where nodes exceed the maximum number of keys.
  - Added preliminary tests for inserting key-value pairs, which passed for simple cases.

- **Plan**:
  - Complete the `insert` method, including file synchronization for new nodes.
  - Start the `search` method to allow querying keys in the index file.
  - Update the development log with progress and challenges.

## [2024-12-07 11:30 PM]
- **Reflections**:
  - Accomplished a significant portion of the `create`, `open`, and `insert` commands.
  - Encountered issues with handling large numbers of keys and maintaining parent-child relationships in the B-Tree structure.
  - Found that splitting root nodes requires special handling, which will be addressed in the next session.

- **Next Steps**:
  - Debug and finalize the `insert` command, especially handling node splits.
  - Implement the `search` command fully and test it with various scenarios.
  - Add placeholder implementations for remaining commands (`load`, `print`, `extract`).
